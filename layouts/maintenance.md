![SurviveJS - Maintenance|255|329|front-cover](assets/img/maintenance_title_page_small.png)

**SurviveJS - Maintenance** is meant for anyone who has to develop and maintain JavaScript applications or packages.

The purpose of this book is to gather development practices that are particularly useful for anyone who has to maintain JavaScript code or code that compiles to JavaScript.

I, Juho Vepsäläinen, and my co-author Artem Sapegin, have spent years developing npm packages and JavaScript projects. As a result we have gained insight on how to do it and how **not** to do it. The book combines our experience into a concise format that allows you to improve your development experience.

## What Will You Learn

Unless you work on fresh greenfield projects all the time, maintenance concerns are something that will come up fast. The book has been structured into small parts where you learn:

* How to manage npm packages
* How to improve code quality
* How to set up infrastructure for your project
* How to document the project in a sustainable manner
* How to plan for the future

In addition, there are small appendices that delve into deeper detail on topics such as monorepos and customizing ESLint.
